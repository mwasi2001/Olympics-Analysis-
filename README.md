 ------------------------------------------------------------   About Dataset  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Within a context of analyzing Olympic data, there are two CSV files in this dataset. 
The initial file, noc_regions.csv, has 230 entries spread across 3 columns: NOC,
region and notes. In this case, the NOC column gives different National Olympic Committee (NOC) codes that represent countries or regions participating in the Olympics. Further on,
the region column provides the corresponding names of regions or countries for every NOC code listed. 
Further still, more details contained in the notes column though only sparsely populated with just 21 non-null entries.
Note that some values are missing in the region column showing that not all NOC codes have been given a name of their respective regions in this data set.

The second one is much larger as it comprises fifteen columns which have a total of two hundred seventy one thousand one hundred sixteen entries (271116).
It captures information about individual athletes who took part in the Olympic Games with great detail. 
These include basic demographic attributes such as ID, Name, Sex, Age, Height and Weight; alongside records 
related to their participation at Olympics which consist Team; NOC; Games; Year; Season; City; Sport; Event and Medal. By far the most significant among these is the Medal column as it indicates 
if an athlete won a medal and what type it was if he/she did so. However
